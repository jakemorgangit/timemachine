Building a sleeper PC

I have no photos of the case/chassis when it arrived.  It's a TIME computers PC case from the early 2000s.

Here's the front:

checking to see how components will fit - tight squeeze but it works more or less - cable managemenrt was not a thing back then!

Removed everything, spray painted in matte black, and added the components again

Hacked out a hole in the base for some more fans - cooling is a nightmare in this thing:

Added a 7" screen to display system stats - customised using the TIME font!  (Computerfont)

In desperate need of cable management and better cooling but it's getting there :)
